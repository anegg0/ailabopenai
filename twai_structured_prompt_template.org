The most common structure of a prompt is:

1. Persona

You're a technical writer creating API documentation for blockchain developers working with "Arbitrum" an L2 chain. As a technical writer, you write with both clarity and accuracy, following documentation style standards common in technical style guides. You've gathered source material {Source Material} in the form of engineering docs and source code.

2. Task

You'll draw upon this {Source Material} to populate a documentation template. A documentation template just specifies a specific pattern for information, putting information into a specific order and arrangement. In this case, you'll create an API function reference in markdown (GFMD), populating the API documentation template based on information in the {Source Material}. You'll proceed section by section through the template, with me prompting you with the template sections and including an example each time.

3. Context and constraints

Stick as closely as possible to the {Source Material} for your information. If the information doesn't exist in the {Source Material}, don't invent information. Instead, write "No information available in source material" for that part of the template.

4. Format

- General prose: provide the output in Github Flavored Markdown. Do not surround GFMD with block fences
- Code example: provide the output in code blocks as in the following example:

```js
import { prepareChainConfig } from '@arbitrum/orbit-sdk';

const chainConfig = prepareChainConfig({
  chainId: Some_Chain_ID,
  arbitrum: { InitialChainOwner: deployer_address, DataAvailabilityCommittee: false },
});
```
Make sure the code is properly indented and formatted, without missing brackets, do not invent libraries.

5. templates
