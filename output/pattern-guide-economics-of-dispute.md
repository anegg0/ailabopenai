## Economics and Denial-of-Service Mechanisms in Arbitrum BoLD

This document explains the economics and denial-of-service mechanisms built into Arbitrum BoLD. It covers the trade-offs Arbitrum makes to enable permissionless validation, explaining the key problems in an accessible way.

### Background

[Arbitrum One](https://arbitrum.io/) is currently one of the most widely adopted Ethereum scaling solutions, with [~$18bn USD in total-value-locked](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum) at the time of writing. Its popularity stems from its scaling properties, such as 250ms block times, security features, and approach to decentralization. Arbitrum One is governed by the Arbitrum DAO, one of the most active and robust on-chain organizations.

However, Arbitrum has not yet achieved full decentralization. Currently, withdrawals from Arbitrum One back to Ethereum are verified by a permissioned list of validators. Although these validators can challenge invalid withdrawals, the system prevents anyone outside this list from holding them accountable. This limits Arbitrum One to being categorized as a Stage 1 rollup according to [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary), meaning it still has constraints preventing it from reaching its full potential.

Arbitrum One is called "optimistic" because claims about its state settle to Ethereum after a period of ~7 days, during which they can be disputed. This is analogous to a check that can be cashed immediately but can be disputed within a specific timeframe if there is an issue. Because Arbitrum's state is deterministic, a validator running a node and following the chain will always know if a posted claim is invalid. A key decentralization property allows anyone who knows the correct claim to challenge invalid claims and win. This preserves the accurate history of Arbitrum settling to Ethereum and protects the integrity of users' funds and withdrawals using a "single honest party" property. As long as there is a single entity following the chain and willing to dispute a claim, Arbitrum's security guarantees are maintained.

Today, Arbitrum One's security properties are defined by the size of its permissioned set of validators. Validators could collude or settle an incorrect history, and users have no recourse aside from the Arbitrum One security council stepping in. Elevating Arbitrum One's decentralization requires a different approach.

In the fall of 2023, Offchain Labs announced [Arbitrum BOLD](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc), a brand new dispute resolution protocol built from the ground up that will bring Arbitrum chains to the next level of decentralization. BOLD, standing for Bounded Liquidity Delay, allows for permissionless validation of Arbitrum chains. This means the DAO can remove the list of allowed validators, let anyone challenge claims made about Arbitrum states on Ethereum, and win against them if they are incorrect.

This document explores the economics and trade-offs Arbitrum must make to enable permissionless validation.

### Settling Arbitrum States to Ethereum

"Arbitrum settles its state to Ethereum" means that all Arbitrum One transactions can be recreated by reading data from Ethereum L1. Compressed batches of all L2 transactions are frequently posted to Ethereum. Once a batch transaction is included in a finalized block on Ethereum, its history will never be reverted on Arbitrum. However, Ethereum does not know if a batch posted to it refers to a correct Arbitrum history. For verifying batch integrity, a separate process confirms batch correctness on Ethereum.

Validators check the correctness of batches by following the Arbitrum chain. Approximately every hour, they post an "assertion," which attests to the validity of a batch, stating, "I have verified this batch." As Ethereum does not know what is correct on Arbitrum, it allows ~7 days for anyone to dispute these assertions.

### Withdrawing Assets Back to Ethereum from Arbitrum

Users of Arbitrum One who have bridged assets from Ethereum can withdraw said assets at any time. However, for this withdrawal to be fully executed, a withdrawal claim must correspond to a confirmed assertion on Ethereum. For instance, Alice starts a withdrawal transaction on Arbitrum One, which gets posted in a batch on Ethereum. Then, a validator will post an assertion about that batch on Ethereum one hour later. The assertion has a ~7-day window during which anyone can dispute it. Otherwise, it will get confirmed. After that window passes, Alice will receive her withdrawn assets on Ethereum and is free to use them as she pleases.

"Settling states" and having a ~7-day dispute window ensures assets can be withdrawn safely. Allowing anyone to dispute invalid claims and win helps keep withdrawals protected by strong security guarantees, without needing to trust a group of validators. This "permissionless validation" separates Optimistic Rollups from side chains.

### The Dispute Period

The dispute window for assertions about Arbitrum One on Ethereum exists because Ethereum itself has no knowledge about what is correct on Arbitrum One. The two blockchains are different domains with different states. Ethereum can be used as a neutral referee for parties to dispute claims about Arbitrum One. The ~7-day window is considered the maximum period an adversary could delay Ethereum before social intervention, as proposed by Vitalik Buterin. This window gives enough time for parties to catch invalid claims and challenge them accordingly.

### Dispute Resolution Times

An actual dispute occurs when a party disagrees with an assertion on Ethereum and posts an assertion they know to be correct. This creates a "fork" in the chain of assertions, requiring a resolution process.

Once a dispute is ongoing, it will take time to resolve, as Ethereum has no knowledge of the correctness of Arbitrum states. Ethereum must then give sufficient time for parties to provide their burden of proof and declare a winner. The new Arbitrum BOLD protocol guarantees that a dispute will be resolved within 7 days as long as an honest party is present to defend against invalid claims.

As assertions have a dispute window of 7 days, and disputes require an additional 7 days to resolve, a dispute made at the last second would delay assertion confirmation to a maximum of 14 days, or 2 weeks. BOLD is the only dispute protocol known to guarantee this bound.

### The Cost of Delaying Withdrawals

Delaying withdrawals incurs opportunity cost and a worse user experience for users wanting to withdraw their assets. In the happy case where no disputes exist, withdrawals already have a baked-in, 7-day delay. A dispute incurs an additional 7 days on top of that maximum. The problem is that disputes delay all pending withdrawals from Arbitrum One back to Ethereum, not just a single claim. As such, disputing a claim must have a cost for the initiator proportional to the opportunity cost they impose on Arbitrum users.

#### Requiring a Bond to Become a Validator

The entities responsible for posting assertions about Arbitrum state to Ethereum are called validators. If posting assertions were free, anyone could create conflicting assertions to always delay withdrawals by 14 days instead of 7. As such, Arbitrum requires validators to put in a "security deposit," known as a bond, to be allowed to post assertions. Validators can withdraw their bond as soon as their latest posted assertion has been confirmed and end their responsibilities.

#### Pricing Bonds

Ensuring assertions are frequently posted is a requirement for Arbitrum, but it should not be a privilege easily obtained. The security deposit for Arbitrum validators is priced based on opportunity cost.

In a bank-run scenario, the [Arbitrum One bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8315177ab297ba92a06054ce80a67ed4dbd7ed3a) contains approximately $5.4bn worth of assets at the time of writing on April 15, 2024. Assuming funds could earn a 5% APY if invested, the opportunity cost of 1 extra week of delay is approximately USD 5,200,000. Given this scenario, a bond for assertion posters is recommended to be in the range of ~$2.5M - $5M.

Honest parties can always withdraw their bond once their assertions are confirmed. However, adversaries stand to lose the entirety of their bond if they post invalid claims. A large bond size drastically improves the economic security of the system based on these two axes.

#### Centralization Concerns

Requiring a high bond to post assertions about Arbitrum seems centralizing, as it replaces a whitelist of validators with a system that requires significant funds to participate. However, BOLD ships with a trustless bonding pool for assertion posting. Any group of honest parties can pool funds into a simple contract that will post an assertion to Ethereum without needing to trust each other. This approach maintains the safety and decentralization of BOLD.

We claim optimizing for the unhappy case is more important than the happy case. As there only needs to be one honest assertion poster, it falls into the security budget of the chain to price in a $2M bond to become a validator. It should be expensive to delay Arbitrum One withdrawals, and it should also have a high barrier to entry to perform a key responsibility. As long as disputes can be made in a trustless manner and trustless pools are available in production, the security properties of assertion posting are upheld.

### Resolving Disputes

One of the core properties BOLD achieves is providing a fixed, upper-bound for dispute resolution times. This section discusses the constraints required to achieve this from first principles.

#### Dispute Game Overview

Every game between adversarial parties needs a refereeâ€”a neutral party that can enforce the rules to

 declare a fair winner. Arbitrum BOLD relies on Ethereum as its referee due to its properties as the most decentralized, censorship-resistant smart contract chain in the world.

When a dispute occurs about Arbitrum One assertions on Ethereum, a protocol resolves them. A dispute is about the blockhash of an Arbitrum One block at a given height. Ethereum does not know which claim is correct and relies on a dispute game to be played out. The game involves parties making claims with proof to narrow down their disagreement to a single step of execution within the execution of a block, called a one-step proof (OSP). Ethereum can then verify this OSP by itself and declare a winner as the neutral referee.

The "rules" of the dispute involve parties making claims with proofs to reach the single point of disagreement. Parties "narrow down" their claims via moves called bisections. After a party has made a bisection, it has nothing else left to do until another party counters it. The core of the system is that an honest party winning a one-step proof leaves the evil party with no other moves to make. Once the honest party has accumulated enough time not-countered, it will be declared the winner.

Compared to other dispute protocols, BOLD is not a dispute between two specific Ethereum addresses, such as Alice and Bob. Instead, it is a dispute between an absolute, correct history vs. an incorrect one. Claims in BOLD are not attached to a particular address or validator but to Merkle commitments of an Arbitrum chain's history. If Alice and Charlie are both honest, and Bob is malicious, Alice and Charlie can play the game as part of a single "team." If Alice goes offline in the middle of a dispute game, Charlie can continue resolving the game in the honest team's favor at any time because Charlie and Alice are being honest, which means they will claim and make moves on the correct history. This is why we say BOLD enables "trustless cooperation," as there is no need for communication between honest parties. We believe committing a set of chain history hashes instead of a specific hash at a moment in time is crucial for securing dispute protocols.

#### Spamming the Dispute Game

BOLD is a dispute game in which the party that has accumulated ~7 days "not-countered" wins. Parties are incentivized to counter any new claims as soon as they appear to "block" their rivals from increasing their timers. For honest parties, responding to claims may sometimes require offchain computational work, which needs access to computational resources such as CPUs. However, evil parties can make claims that are eventually found to be junk while making honest parties do actual work.

Since evil parties can submit junk that makes honest parties do work, there must be an economic cost associated with making moves in the dispute game. This helps prevent spam attacks in dispute games.

#### The Cost of Moves

When pricing the bonds required to make claims within disputes, we consider the marginal costs that the honest party incurs for each claim an evil party makes. This includes the number of adversary moves multiplied by the gas cost of making bisections and claims and estimates of offchain computational costs. We deem this the marginal cost of a party in a dispute.

In BOLD, the space of disagreements between parties is of max size 2^43. As such, the dispute game must be played at different levels of granularity to make it computationally feasible.

For instance, say we have two 1-meter sticks that seem identical, and we want to determine where they differ. They appear identical at the centimeter level, so we need to go down to the millimeter level, then the micrometer level, and then figure out where they differ at the nanometer level.

This is what BOLD does over the space of disputes. Parties play the same game at different levels of granularity. At the centimeter level, each centimeter could trigger a millimeter dispute, and each millimeter dispute could have many micrometer disputes, etc. This fans out to many potential dispute games unless spam is discouraged.

#### Preventing Spam

Since Ethereum knows nothing about which claims are honest or evil until a one-step proof is reached, how can the protocol detect and discourage spam? A key insight is that honest parties only need to make one honest claim. Honest parties will never spam and create thousands of conflicting claims with themselves. Given this, we can put a price tag on making moves by looking at the "resource ratio" between honest and evil parties, as defined in the BOLD research paper.

This ratio is essentially the gas + staking (or bonding) marginal costs of the adversary to the honest party. This means that certain values input into the equations can lead to different ratios. For instance, we can say the adversary has to pay 10x the marginal costs of the honest party. However, aiming to increase this ratio significantly by plugging in different values leads to higher costs for all parties.

#### Dispute Mini-Bonds

We require parties to lock up some capital called a "mini-bond" when making big claims in a dispute. These bonds are not needed when making bisection moves but are critical for posting an initial claim. Pricing these mini-bonds helps achieve a high resource ratio of evil parties to honest parties.

If we can multiply the cost to the evil party by some multiplier of the honest party, we will get significant security benefits. For instance, imagine if a 1 billion dollar attack can be defended by simply pooling together 10 million dollars. Is it possible to achieve such a ratio?

Let's explore the limitations of making the cost to evil parties high vs. that of the honest parties.

If we aim to have a constant resource ratio > 1, we must ensure that if the adversary makes N stakes at any level, they can force the honest party to make N stakes at the next level down where the adversary can choose not to place any stakes at all. In terms of resource ratio, to make the adversary always pay 10x in staking, we need to make the bond amount at one level 10x more than the next. As there are multiple levels, the equations for the bond size include an exponential factor on the desired constant resource ratio > 1.

Below, we plot the bond size vs. the resource ratio of evil to honest costs. The source for these equations is in the research paper and [plotted in this calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/digjlq4vly).

If we desire a constant resource ratio of evil to honest costs > 1, the required bond size in ETH increases as a polynomial at a particular challenge level.

#### Trade-offs

Having a 1000x resource ratio would be nice in theory, but it would require a bond of 1M ETH ($3.5bn) to open a challenge in the first place, which is unreasonable. Instead, we can explore a more feasible ratio of 10x.

The trade-off here is the higher the resource ratio we want, the more expensive it is for both honest and evil parties to make claims in disputes. However, claims can always be made through a trustless pool. Honest parties can pool together funds to participate in disputes.

#### The Sweet Spot

At a resource ratio of 10x, resolving a single adversarial claim in a dispute would cost honest parties approximately $16M. Honest parties will always be refunded and possibly rewarded, while evil parties always stand to lose 100% of their bond. The DAO could consider the cost of incentivizing a single honest staker in the happy case to be the security budget of the chain. This means defending against a $1 billion attack would require $100M total to defend, with the entire amount being refunded while the attacker loses all $1bn.

### Thinking About Incentives

Although we have made claims with hard numbers about how to price disputes and withdrawal delays in Arbitrum BOLD, we also take a step back and consider the game theoretical assumptions we are making. Arbitrum One is a complex protocol used by many groups of people with different incentives. The research team at Offchain Labs has spent considerable effort studying the game theory of validators in Optimistic Rollup. Honest parties represent everyone that has funds on-chain, and they have a significant amount to gain by winning the challengeâ€”as they can prevent the loss of their assets rather than losing them.

A more complex model is proposed by Akaki Mamageishvili and Ed Felten in their paper ["Incentive Schemes for Rollup Validators"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02880). The paper looks at what incentives are needed to get parties to check whether assertions are correct. It finds that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium, and only a mixed equilibrium if there is no incentive for honest validators. However, the research showed a pure strategy equilibrium can be reached if honest parties are incentivized to check results. The problem of honest validators "free riding" and not checking is well-documented as the [verifier's dilemma](https://www.smithandcrown.com/glossary/verifiers-dilemma). Future iterations of BOLD could include "attention challenges" that reward honest validators for also doing their job.

### Conclusion

This document summarizes the rationale behind choosing bond sizes and the cost of spam prevention in Optimistic Rollup dispute protocols. We recommend that bond sizes be high enough to discourage challenges from being opened, as evil parties will always stand to lose when playing the game. As Arbitrum BOLD does not tie disputes to specific addresses, honest parties can have trustless cooperation to resolve disputes if desired. Making the cost to evil parties 10x that of the honest party leads to favorable economic properties for pricing bonds. Finally, we discuss the game theory of Optimistic Rollups and argue that solving the verifier's dilemma by incentivizing honest validators is essential.
